## Bio

I am an entrepreneur, a Canadian Army Lieutenant-Colonel (Ret'd), former university faculty at two universities and globetrotter, with expertise in leadership, strategy, intelligence, influence, statistics and data science. I have been a full-time faculty in the Department of Organizational Behaviour, Human Resources Management and Management in the School of Business at MacEwan University from Nov 2013 to Sep 2018. I have a Masters in Industrial-Organizational Psychology from Université du Québec à Montréal and am a graduate of Joint Command & Staff Programme (JCSP) at the Canadian Forces College.

I retired at the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel from the Canadian Army Reserves (Intelligence) in Aug 2015 after 30 years of service, most of those full-time, with four overseas operational deployments (Bosnia 1993-94, and 1995; Afghanistan 2006-07, and 2012-13). After the events of September 11, 2001, I set out to research and plan for a new Canadian military capability to manoeuvre on the informational, cognitive and moral sphere. I officially stood up the Canadian Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) Group in Jan 2004, a new capability for the Canadian Forces, was its first Commanding Officer until Aug 2009, achieving its mission by selecting, training, deploying and supporting hundreds of PSYOPS military personnel on overseas operations over that time frame. PSYOPS constitute a planned process of conveying messages to selected target audiences (enemy, neutral and friendly) in foreign military operations, promoting particular themes that result in desired attitudes and behaviour that affect the achievement of political and military objectives.   

My expertise in influence, PSYOPS, Information Operations, Strategic Communications, Counter-Propaganda, Strategy and Counterinsurgency has been sought internationally, as an invited guest speaker by US Joint Special Operations University, NATO (SHAPE), the Royal Military College of Canada, several Information Operations Conferences in Europe, the Canadian Forces College, Defence Research & Development Canada, the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, the Institute for Military Operations of the Royal Danish Defence College, CityForum’s “Supporting Land Operations” roundtable sponsored by the UK Land Forces and the “Strategic Communications” roundtable chaired by the UK Chief of Defence Staff in London, UK.
 
I also worked as a consultant for the HayGroup, an international management consulting firm, from Jan 2000 to May 2002, and later as a full-time lecturer in Psychology and Leadership at the Royal Military College of Canada, from Jun 2002 to Feb 2004. I was Commanding Officer of the 4th Intelligence Company in Montreal from 1999 to 2002. In 1998, I started and ran HumanSource Inc until 2004, one of the first Canadian consulting firms dedicated to Strategic/Customer/Competitive Intelligence.
